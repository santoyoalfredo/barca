# Football Statistics Project
This project is a web application for comparing statistical data for football (soccer) players, teams, etc.
While primarily focused on FC Barcelona the project is generic and can be applied to any or multiple teams.

The project is currently being developed in the `dev` branch until proper testing is done for base version features. You can see the progress in the projects page.
