# Football Statistics Project
This project is a web application for comparing statistical data for football (soccer) players, teams, etc.
While primarily focused on FC Barcelona the project is generic and can be applied to any or multiple teams.

The project is currently being developed in the `dev` branch until proper testing is done for base version features. You can see the progress in the projects page.

The application is built using Python as the core language and the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework for the front-end and back-end. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and a bit of Javascript are used for the front-end. At the moment testing is done through unit and integration tests and are run using [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/). System testing through [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) is planned for a later time. [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) is used to monitor code coverage from the written tests.

A live version of the application is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and is available to demo:

## Motivations
I decided to work on this project since I was able to combine my interests in sports and software development. Building this application will allow me to further enhance my current knowledge and add to my skillset as I work with more technologies. In the end I would also like to involve statistical and correlation analysis and possibly generate predictions based on existing data sets.
